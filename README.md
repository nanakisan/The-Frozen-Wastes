The Frozen Wastes
=================

A Minecraft modpack
This modpack is something i've been working on for awhile now. Its main premise is as follows

you will freeze to death! Find heat quickly!  
Infrastructure is a absolute must.  
Mods that add various "mechanics" are at a bare minimum.  
Exploration and Expansion is highly recommended.  
There will be quests but not a lot. This will mostly use the lore pages more then anything.  
Areas of interest will be locked using quest doors. (I will be removing the wand of the traveler.)  
Don't mine too deep or be underground for too long. Lava filled caves are going to be your worst nightmare
